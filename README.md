A study conducted in 2020 shows that the poultry industry provided 2.1 million jobs, $121.1 billion in wages, $41.9 billion in government revenue, and $576.6 billion in economic activity in the United States[1]. There are states which predominantly rely on the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting industries. To name a few, Iowa as a leading state based on poultry production in 2021, puts agriculture as the sixth largest industry sector after finance, manufacturing, government enterprises, services, and education and health care. Last but not least, although this industry is clearly not the highest contributor of GDP in the U.S., poultry plays an important role in terms of food security.

Predation has been the number one threat to the poultry business. A number of different predator species can cause damage and economic losses to poultry flocks. The U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s Wildlife Services estimated in its annual Program Data Reports for the fiscal year 2019 a $232 million in livestock loss due to predation. Depending on the size of the poultry flocks, predation is relatively a bigger concern for backyard flocks and organic poultry producers. The reason for this is in the way flocks are managed, which are typically housed in a variety of facility types that may or may not offer secure predator protection. A system that allows automation of predator identification in the perimeter of the poultry will help owners to prevent losses due to these predators.
